Port Forwarding Rules

A server through the use of server software provides response 
to request through ports
The virtual machine created is an Ubuntu Virtual server
name: newserver
It has two services installed on It
Which are runnning and provides their services through
ports exposed by the newserver

Jenkins is installed to be served on port 8080 of the VM(Guest)
Gitlab is installed to be served on port 80 of the VM(Guest)

There should be a way to acces this service from the outside
This is where port forwarding comes in
It provides a way to connect to your VM through port forwarding configurations

Question: Hooks
Why do I have to keep running the command
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
everytime I restart my virtual machine to enable gitlab listen
on my specified port: 8081

Another hook:
I configured gitlb to listen on port 8081
Configured the port forwarding on vm box
Upon running this command on my vm
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :8081
I found out Unicorn the websercer for gitlab is listening both
on port 80 and 8081, and unicorn prefers to serve on port 80
When the port configuration of the guest is et to 80 but does not 
server when the port configuration of the guest is set to 8081
even if unicorn(webserver of gitlab) is listening on that port too.
I do not know why tho...
